## Contribution guidelines

1)	Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist;
2)	Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug;
3)	Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue;
4)	Fork the repository on BitBucket.

#### Making Changes:

**Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.**

*	This is usually the master branch;
*	Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch;
*	Please avoid working directly on the master branch;
*	Make commits of logical units;
*	Check for unnecessary whitespace with `$ git diff --check` before committing;
*	Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format;
*	Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes;
*	Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
